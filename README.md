- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - The repo and site live within the GitHub world

## Available Scripts

You can run the following popular commands:

### `npm start`

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This will deploy the site to GitHub pages. It will also recreate the CNAME file for DNS purposes because GitHub likes to delete things apparently.
